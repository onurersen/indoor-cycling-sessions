**Benefits of Indoor Cycling**

The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) specifically mentions the following fitness benefits with regard to indoor cycling:

**1. Low Impact**
Indoor cycling is a low-impact activity. 
People recovering from orthopedic injuries often participate in indoor cycling as part of the rehabilitation protocol. 
If cycling is done correctly, there is minimal impact on the hip, knee, and ankle joints. 
A person, whether recovering from injury or not, avoids the pounding associated with other activities such as running.

**2. Muscular Endurance**
Muscular endurance refers to the ability of a muscle to continually and repeatedly exert force over an extended period of time. 
When you are pedaling against resistance in indoor cycling you increase the endurance of the muscles in the legs to include the quadriceps,
hamstrings, gluteus, and the calf muscles. Working these muscles also helps to strengthen surrounding bones, tendons, 
and ligaments increasing overall strength so that activities of daily living can be performed with ease.

**3. Stress Levels**
Weâ€™ve all heard about the runner's high. 
An indoor cycling class can provide that same rush of adrenaline and a release of happy mood-inducing neurotransmitters 
known as endorphins. Endorphins tend to create feelings of euphoria, lower stress levels, and enhance the body's immune response.

**4. Cardiovascular**
ACSM recommends that healthy adults should get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week. 
Exercise recommendations can be achieved through 30-60 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise (five days per week) or 
20-60 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise (three days per week). An indoor cycling class can keep your heart rate 
well within a vigorous range for approximately 45-60 minutes. As with all continuous cardiovascular activity, 
an indoor cycling program can help lower the risk of coronary artery disease.
